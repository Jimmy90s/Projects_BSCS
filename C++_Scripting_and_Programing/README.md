# Scripting and Programing Applications - C++
Final Project for Western Governors University class "Scripting and Programming Applications".

To run classRoster.sln project: place all .cpp and .h files in a single folder called student_data1 . Then place student_data1 and classRoster.sln file into another folder together.

Task:

You must write a program containing five classes (i.e., Student , SecurityStudent , NetworkStudent , SoftwareStudent , and Roster ). The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree. This information can be found in the studentData table below. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data (see part F4 in the requirements below). While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
Overall Course Competencies:

- Introduction to Programming:
  - The graduate applies fundamental programming concepts in a specific programming environment.
- Variables and Data Types:
  - The graduate prepares code which declares, initializes, and assigns values to variables of appropriate types as part of the application development process.
- Control Structures:
  - The graduate writes code that implements decision and loop constructs to control the flow of a program.
- Arrays:
  - The graduate creates arrays in order to solve complex problems.
- Pointers and Memory:
  - The graduate applies pointers to solve complex problems.
- Functions:
  - The graduate writes code that creates and manipulates functions and files.
- Object-Oriented Paradigm:
  - The graduate applies object-oriented programming concepts in order to create a basic application.
