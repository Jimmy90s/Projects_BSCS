# Projects 
## [ML Price Prediction](https://github.com/Jimmy90s/Projects_BSCS/tree/main/ML%20Price%20Prediction)

### WGU BSCS Capstone Project
This is my final capstone project for Western Governors University Software where I cleaned data using pandas, visualized with seaborn and trained a few machine learning models using sklearn
- Machine learning model training
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization

## [Package Delivery Solution](https://github.com/Jimmy90s/Projects_BSCS/tree/main/Package%20Delivery%20Solution)

#### Data Structures and Algorithms 2 Project
For this assessment, I applied the algorithms and data structures I studied in this course to solve a real programming problem. I implemented a nearest neighbor algorithm to route delivery trucks that will allow you to meet all delivery deadlines while traveling the least number of miles. I also described and justified the decisions I made while creating this program.
- Implementation of a nearest neighbor algorithm
