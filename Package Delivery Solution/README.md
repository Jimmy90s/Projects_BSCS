# Package Delivery Solution

This is my final project for Data Structures and Algorithms II â€“ C950 at Western Governors University.

### Skills Used:
- Non-Linear Data Structures
- Hashing Algorithms and Structures
- Dictionaries and Sets
- Self-Adjusting Data Structures
- Self-Adjusting Heuristics
- NP-Completeness and Turing Machines

### Project Premise
For this assessment, I applied the algorithms and data structures I studied in this course to solve a real programming problem. I implemented a nearest neighbor algorithm to route delivery trucks that will allow you to meet all delivery deadlines while traveling the least number of miles. I also described and justified the decisions I made while creating this program.

### Overview of class:
Data Structures and Algorithms II explores the analysis and implementation of high-performance data structures and supporting algorithms, including graphs, hashing, self-adjusting data structures, set representations, and dynamic programming. The course also introduces students to NP-complete problems. The course discusses how to use Python techniques to implement software solutions for problems of memory management and data compression. This course has two prerequisites: Data Structures and Algorithms I and Discrete Math II.
